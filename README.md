## Development
- Meet during lab times to work on features

### Conventions
 - Class names = ClassName extends OtherClass
 - Variables = String variableName = "";
 - Static final fields = FINAL_FIELD = 10;
 - JavaDoc public methods

## Pull Requests
- When a feature is completed, open a PR on bitbucket marking it with [Ready]
- Another team member will review it and make any comments, which the developer can then address
- If features need to be tweaked or added to
- Once happy, the PR can be merged into master.

### Pull Request Criterion
- Feature must function as expected
- Automated tests for both logic and UI must be present and must all pass

## Testing
- For views, test they they are present and they respond to user actions
- Test all methods that have logic
- Test methods that have a return value to ensure what is being returned is what is expected.
